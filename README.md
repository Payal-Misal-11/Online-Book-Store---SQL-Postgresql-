📌 SQL Project – Online Bookstore Analysis

I recently completed an SQL Data Analysis Project where I worked with an Online Bookstore dataset.

In this project, I created database tables, imported CSV data, and wrote multiple SQL queries to extract key insights.
I applied concepts like joins, aggregation, grouping, filtering, ordering, subqueries etc. to analyze customer behavior, book sales, revenue, most demanded genres, authors and many more insights.

🔍 Key Highlights:
Designed database tables (Books, Customers, Orders)
Imported data using COPY command
Applied real SQL operations to generate insights
Covered both basic & advanced SQL queries
Identified top selling books, genres, authors, revenue, stock left etc.

📂 What is included in this repo?
SQL file containing all database creation queries
Data importing statements
More than 20 SQL queries for insights

📎 Here I’m sharing the full SQL file of this project.
